No need to guess, that's Khanh pronounced as KAYN, nice to meet you! 

Iâ€™m a graduate student studying Data Science, building on a strong foundation from my B.S. in Biochemistry at UC San Diego. For over five years, I've honed my professional experience as a biochemist, working in biotech and the medical device industries. Throughout these experiences, I gravitated and specialized in process optimization and data analysis- especially as it was the best way for me to see and show the real impact of my efforts. 

I am fully committed to applying my skills across industries, combining my scientific approach with data-driven strategies to tackle real-world problems. As such, I am eager to leverage my interest and attention to detail in data-focused roles. This website is an open invitation to view my experiences and portfolio as I continue to practice and improve as a data scientist. 

I've recently gained an interest in machine learning techniques with regard to natural language processing (NLP), check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/k-phantastic) for new projects!
